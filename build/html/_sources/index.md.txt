1. Optimizing for simple and fast UX. A user-experience that anyone with simple knowledge of python can use.
2. Rich UI features. The components provide minimal, interactive and beautiful visualization interfaces.
3. Readily provides APIs. Connection to the UI elements to your python script are taken care out-of-the-box.
