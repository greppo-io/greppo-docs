# Input components

The components that provide an API interface to input components (form type elements) are described here. Greppo uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the web-applications and uses the custom-form components supported within tailwindcss. Currently the input components that are suported are:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

number
select
multiselect
```

Many more input components are forseen in the milestones for the coming releases.
