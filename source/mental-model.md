# Mental model

Greppo's interface is simple and is designed with the intention of getting out of the users way. We want to make it easy to build a geospatial app quickly.

Greppo focuses on two ideas,

* Use native python code and other standard libraries for analysis.
* Use simple macros to prepare a user code for execution within Greppo.

The first idea ensures as much freedom as possible in terms of compatability with libraries commonly used for data
science and geospatial analysis. The second is to keep Greppo in the background and only surface a small interface
for the user to work with. Both ideas keep the mental bandwidth of using a new library low and focus on simple and
intuitive UX.

With this in mind, the following code snippets breaks down a common user-script to illustrate the two ideas. The entire code as a single file is here <TODO> and to run the code before looking at the explanation, simply run `` <TODO>.

* Imports

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from greppo_app import gpo
```

* For each Greppo app, we have a base layer that is a required setup from the user.

```python

gpo.base_layer(
    name="CartoDB Light",
    visible=True,
    url="https://cartodb-basemaps-a.global.ssl.fastly.net/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}@2x.png",
    subdomains=None,
    attribution='&copy; <a target="_blank" href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors',
)

```

* {code}`gpo.number` is Greppo primitive for user interaction for a number. Each defines the inputs they want in app, in this case a number, that they will use to manipulate the GIS data. Here, for :code:`gpo.number` there is a :code:`value` arg that defines the initial default value and a :code:`name` arg that is a _unique_ identifier for that input. Greppo uses the :code:`name` to provide a reactive feedback when rendering the app.

```python

number_1 = gpo.number(value=10, name="Number input 1")

```

* Regular GDF code a Data Scientist is familiar with.

```python

data_gdf_1 = gpd.read_file("tests/data/communes.geojson")

```

* Here the Greppo user closes the feedback loop and uses the :code:`gpo.number` input to perform analysis. This example is trivial but gives you a clear idea of how things work. When Greppo renders this code, the User can interact with the front-end to dynamically pass values and recompute the data.

```python

data_gdf_1["Value"] = pd.Series(
    np.ones(len(data_gdf_1["code"])) * number_1, index=data_gdf_1.index
)

```

* As with the :code:`gpo.base_layer`, a Greppo app must define a required :code:`gpo.overlay_layer`.

```python

gpo.overlay_layer(
    data_gdf_1,
    title="Communes",
    description="Communes in Normandy, France",
    style={"fillColor": "#F87979"},
    visible=True,
)

```

* Generic Python to perform some action, in this case construct a list of random numbers.

```python

y = []
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    y.append(np.random.randint(0, 100))

```

* To complete this trivial example, this :code:`gpo.line_chart` gives you an idea of the visualization tools a Greppo
   app has access to. Here, the random number list generated above is plotted as a line chart.

```python

gpo.line_chart(
    name="some-name",
    title="some_title",
    description="some_chart",
    x=[i for i in range(10)],
    y=y,
)

```
